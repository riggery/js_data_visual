#Data Visualization Exercises

##Part 1: Shapes Object Library

Write a set of objects in pure Javascript (i.e. not coffeescript) to
draw basic geometric shapes.


## Part 2: Basic Data Visualization

In the [data](./data) directory there are a couple of sample data sets extracted from [here](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/visualizing.datatables/) and [here](https://github.com/deremer/Cities/). 

The data is available in a couple of formats -- the original plain text, .json, and .js formats. The .js files are included to simplify working with the data in environments that don't support AJAX.

Using the `Line` and `Text` objects that you defined in Part 1, draw a timeseries line chart of the co2 data [here](./data/co2.js). Feel free to use generic javascript helper libraries like [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) or [jquery](http://jquery.com/) but don't use another data visualization framework.
